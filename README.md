# McScrape
An in-progress data science project that seeks to answer:

• In which Massachusetts counties are there the greatest number of McDonald’s restaurants?

• Is there a correlation between a high number of McDonald’s restaurants and low per capita income by county?

Location data was obtained through modified Get requests to MD's restaurant locator application.

All code for this project is written in Jupyter Notebooks.
